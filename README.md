# Nous Fullstack coding exercise

We have provided starting points for the exercise for both Backend and Frontend. Feel free to use these or if you are more familiar with other setups you can use your own.

## Backend

We have provided the skeleton of an Express server using NodeJS and Typescript.

To run the server:

- install NodeJS
- install yarn `$ npm install --global yarn`
- install dependencies `$ yarn`
- start the server `$ npm start`

## Frontend

We have provided a Typescript/React/Tailwind client scaffolded with Vite.
